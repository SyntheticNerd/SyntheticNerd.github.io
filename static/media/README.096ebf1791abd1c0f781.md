# K.A. Construction React Single Page Landing

## Overview

This is a desktop website for a mock business called K.A. Construction. It was designed and developed to be interactive and engaging in order to hold the attention of users and encourage them to keep exploring. There are little surprises packed into this landing page that will keep you looking for more.

Special thanks to [Klay Simmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klay-simmons-b82b08221/) for the awesome design, invaluable input, and well organized figma project.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS components
- CSS Flex Box
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Scroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro)

### What I learned

Working with a good designer can be a great experience. Being able to look at a design together allowing time to ask questions and discuss the functions of certain feature. We were able to quickly work with each other to assemble a design guide that could easily be translated to CSS variable.

Having access to a live figma project takes all the guess work out of sizing elements or typeface. Inspecting elements on figma lets you look at generated code, especially helpful for things like gradients.

I took the opportunity to learn some new tools. I learned to animate objects based on their appearance in the viewport, but I decided to scap that idea and work with a parallax package. [React Sroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) was really easy to use once you got use to working with `scrollStart` and `scrollEnd` props. With React Scroll Parallax I was able to add a variety of different animations based on scroll position that really brought the website to life.
